# React, Redux Saga, Webpack 2 boilerplate

## What is this ?
This is a folk version of [React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate](https://github.com/Stanko/react-redux-webpack2-boilerplate), which replacing [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) by [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

The purpose of the boilerplate is to keep the code base as simple as possible, but fully completed features which provides better understanding for starters.

Starting your project but you don't want to concern everything such as integrating with CI, test ..., this [react-redux-saga-boilerplate](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-redux-saga-boilerplate) is good enough.

## Why Redux Saga (over Redux Thunk) ?
Please read this [article](https://medium.com/@deeepakampolu/from-redux-thunk-to-sagas-2896c0abc676#.dy55mbddx) for overall overview.
* Redux Saga which made use of ES6 Generator function
* Redux Saga is declarative

Declarative programming is writing the code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it.

`in modern FP, we shouldn’t write programs — we should write descriptions of programs, which we can then introspect, transform, and interpret at will.`[See this article](http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp)
